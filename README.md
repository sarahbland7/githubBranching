This is a tutorial to teach branching!
## Authors
If you use this repo to teach github (which we hope you do), please give credit to Rohit Musti and Sarah Bland. 
## Premise
Each branch contains a textfile with a letter.
## Set Up
Clone the file using: 
```
git clone https://github.com/sarahbland7/githubBranching
```
## Step 1
Practice checking out the different branches from the command line.
```
git checkout <branch name>
```
## Step 2
Once you get comfortable with this command, write down the letter and the branch it corresponds to!
## Step 3
Arrange the letters to discover the encoded message.
